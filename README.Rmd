# gkg

Call the Google Knowledge Graph API

## Installation

You can install the package from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JohnCoene/gkg")
```

## Example

Only contains a single function: `gkg`, see man for details. You will need credentials, which you can get for free, see [the prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/prereqs). By default, `gkg` looks for the api key as `GKG_API_KEY` environment variable.

```{r}
gkg("R Programming", languages = "en", types = "Person")
```
